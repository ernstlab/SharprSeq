# SHARPR-seq

## Overview
SHARPR-seq is a computational method for integrating DNA sequence predictions with Sharpr-MPRA reporter tiling data, aimed at high-resolution mapping of regulatory activity within genomic regions. This repository contains the source code and documentation for SHARPR-seq as described in our manuscript.
